### Input / Output

### String

A string is a sequence of characters. To specify a string, we may enclose a sequence of characters between single, double, or triple quotes. Thus, `'Hello world'`, `' "Aravind" '`, `"what's "`, `'''today's "action" plan?'''` are the examples of strings. A string enclosed in single quotes may include double quote marks and vice versa. A string enclosed in triple quotes (also known as docstring, i.e. documentation string) may include both single and double quote marks and may extend over several lines
